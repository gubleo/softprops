## Rules of the road

* What you learn while building is always more important than what you build
* Learn with others when you can
* You are not the code you write
* Joy is experiencing life with others, spark it
* Code is not an asset, it's a liability
* It's okay to color out side the lines
* Don't let perfect be the enemy of good
* It probably needs more tests...
